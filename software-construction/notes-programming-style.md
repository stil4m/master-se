# Good Old Times


### Characteristics:

* Rotating data.
* Not much identifiers, instead arrays. Low readability.
* Comment to explain obscure code.
* Will contain consideration for primary/secondary memory. What does need to be accessed faster.

### Notes:

* Limited amount of memory
* Can't ignore the size of the data to be processed.
* Constraints may be imposed externally (hardware/memory/compatibility of assembly)
* Constraints may be self imposed (follow this style, readibility, past experience).


# Go Forth

### When:

You have a sta

### Characteristics:

* Stack based programming model. Post fix notation.
* Access to a heap with named variables.
* Decompostion in smaller sub problems. Refilling the step with new data structures.

### Notes:

* Only on stack machine interpreters

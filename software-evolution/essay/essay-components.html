<h2>Recap</h2>

<p>
    The paper of matter is 'A Metrics Suite for Object Oriented Design' by S. Chidamber and C Kermerer. As the adoption
    of object oriented (OO) design starts to unfold in the industry, the need to have insight in the the quality and
    form of software increases. While the known metrics do not cover the 'aspects' introduced by OO, the paper tends to
    introduce a suite of 6 metrics especially focuses on the unique aspects of OO like classes, inheritance, method
    passing and encapsulation. <br/>
    The six methods introduced are 'Weighted Methods Per Class' (WMC), 'Depth of Inheritance Tree' (DIT), 'Number of
    Children' (NOC), 'Coupling between object classes' (CBO), 'Response For a Class' (RFC) and 'Lack of Cohesion of
    Methods' (LCOM). The suggested methods are 'held against' the software metric properties that were introduced by
    Weyuker and found to comply with most of them (more on this in ...). To show the application of the metrics, a tool
    was developed to automatically measure the suite on two different OO applications (C++ and Smalltalk)
</p>

<h1>Contributions</h1>

<p>
    The contribution of this paper is a suite of metrics that should give global insight on the internals of an OO
    design which are theoretically grounded. In addition it implicitly states a point of view how we should look at OO
    code and what principles of OO should be considered when measuring this.
</p>

<h1>Structure</h1>

<p>The paper is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The paper starts with an abstract where it introduces the research in the paper. It does not contain a wrap up
        from the conclusion, it only goes up to the empirical research setup. However it recaps the problem nicely.
    </li>
    <li>
        The introduction shows why the research was needed based on two arguments:
        <ol>
            <li>
                The first argument states that the industry is in need for new or improved approaches to software
                development and has an increased focus on process improvement. (This is actually addressed in two
                different arguments.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Previous research has lacked certain aspects:
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of theoretical basis.</li>
                    <li>Lack of desirable measurement properties.</li>
                    <li>Not generalized enough or technology dependent.</li>
                    <li>Too labor intensive to collect.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        This is followed by a illumination of the paper structure. (As expected/required.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Section II describes the research problem.
    </li>
    <li>
        Section III sets a basis for the theory that is used to reflect on the introduced metrics. It consists of three
        parts. 1) An introduction to OO design based on [Booch]. 2) A slight introduction on the measurement theory.
        3) A definition of the identified
    </li>
    <li>
        Section IV sets the choice of evaluation criteria (Weyuker) for the metrics and creates a shortlist of the
        metrics that
        should be evaluated. The metrics that are missing on the shortlist are not applicable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Section V defines the setup for the empirical data collection. (C++ and Smalltalk)
    </li>
    <li>
        Section VI iterates over each of the introduced metrics and for each:
        <ul>
            <li>States the definition, the theoretical basis and the POV.</li>
            <li>The analytical evaluation, which Weyuker properties holds.</li>
            <li>The empirical data and the interpretation of this data.</li>
        </ul>

        Because this section is quite big, it was ended with a summary of one and a half page.
    </li>
    <li>Section VII holds the concluding remarks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    There is no research question, but they state a research problem and how they want to solve this. They actually
    tackle this problem with:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A introduction with a definition of how the metric is implied</li>
    <li>A theoretical basis to reason what a metric would imply</li>
    <li>A point of view (which values of the metric should be good, or what the values would mean)</li>
    <li>Their a proof that the metrics comply to a model [Weyuker]</li>
    <li>Empirical data from real life projects</li>
    <li>Interpretation of this data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
    There is both a summary and concluding remarks. The summary does not really summarize the Results section. It adds a
    little more content and combines the different metrics into combination that may indicate certain software
    properties.
</p>

<p>
    The concluding remarks are not really concluding, it contains some future work and how organisations 'may/can'
    benefit from the work.
</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
    The problem is that the current work on metrics for OO design lack the following properties/are criticised as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Not on a theoretical basis;</li>
    <li>Traditional software complexity metrics do not possess appropriate mathematical properties;</li>
    <li>Existing metrics to not lend themselves for OO design;</li>
    <li>No empirical results have been published.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The problem gives is the main flow through the paper, so it gives almost all of the content reason. The paper should
    be read in detail again to address the lack of purpose.
</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        The need for OO metrics. 'seems appropriate'/'this research addresses these needs'. However when these
        statements are made, the writer does not really make clear why. Later on in the paper he describes with other
        research that current metrics have shortcomings, papers that suggest rule of thumb.
    </li>
    <li>
        'The larger the number of methods that can be invoked from a class, the greater the complexity of the class.'.
        Not true. Accessors/mutators.
    </li>
    <li>
        The notion of complexity is not handled. For example: 'Low cohesion increases complexity', one may argue that
        low cohesion does not increase complexity, but only decrease changeability and analysability.
    </li>
    <li>
        The writer assumes that the need for the lack of metrics for OO can be resolved with a suite of metrics that
        surround the concept of complexity or the notion that they influence complexity. There is a wide variety of the
        type of metrics which are not noted and the writer does not set its point of view merely to the complexity
        metrics. The title may be renamed to 'A Complexity Metrics Suite ...'.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Point of View</h2>

<p>
    The point of view is clearly stated in the paper. The writer introduces his point of view before going in depth.
    There are no further remarks on this. Omitting the complexity thingy.
</p>

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>
    The data consists of two parts, the first is the proof that the metrics comply to the [Weyuker] properties, the
    second part are the histograms that plot the data when the metrics were applied to two real world projects.
</p>
<p>
    The data from the second part is not traceable, but from the time the paper was written open source projects were
    not that commonly used. The question is if it is acceptable that this data is missing. It is not noted in the paper
    why the data is missing.
</p>

<p>
    There is direct motivation to think the data is unbelievable. The writer explains in depth what caused each outlier.
    The experiment could be easily conducted again to verify the outcome. However it may be hard to find a representing
    data set constructed with the same ideology. Since the publication of the paper, new ideas of software have emerged
    [MVVM] or [CDI] which could influence the metrics.
</p>

<h2>Inferences</h2>

<p>I find the number of scientific references pretty low</p>

<p>When property 6 did not hold, the summary arguments this. Couldn't this been foreseen?</p>

<h2>Consequences</h2>

<p>
    The writer introduced 6 metrics that focus on the properties introduced by OO with a prove on theoretical base and
    empirical results.

        This is an essay on the paper 'A Metrics Suite for Object Oriented Design' by S. Chidamber and C.
        Kermerer which is dated from june 1994. Firstly there will be a brief summary about the paper itself followed by
        its merits and drawbacks.

    When object oriented design (OOD) starts to unfold in the industry, the need for feedback on this kind of software
    development increases. The writer addresses the problems that cause the need for a metrics suite that provides the
    required feedback of OOD. The existing metrics lack the theoretical ground [TODO], are not sufficient of OOD,
    technology dependent or too labor intensive to collect.<br>
    The paper introduces six metrics as a suite: 'Weighted Methods Per Class' (WMC), 'Depth of Inheritance Tree' (DIT),
    'Number of Children' (NOC), 'Coupling between object classes' (CBO), 'Response For a Class' (RFC) and 'Lack of
    Cohesion of Methods' (LCOM). These metrics are assessed with the software complexity metric properties introduced by
    [Weyuker] and found to comply with most of them.<br>
    Criticism on previous research was the lack of theoretical basis which is refuted on this paper by the use of the
    model provided by [Weyuker] and lack of empirical data which is added in this paper by the results from an automated
    tool that collected data from two different OO applications (C++ and Smalltalk).<br>
    The main contribution of the paper can be summarized as a suite of six individual software complexity methods that
    can be combined to illuminate design problems and/or choices within an OOD.

    The paper is well structured and meets the expectations from the reader. Where the writer introduces the problem
    (section II), he succeeds this with separate sections on the point of view and approach, which produce a
    approximation to OOD (section III) form which sufficient metrics could be abstracted and how solve the lack of
    theoretical ground (section IV) and empirical data (section V). Section VI contains the actual research results. The
    writer iterates over different metrics and defines accompanied with a point of view, performs an analytical
    evaluation and presents the empirical data and its interpretation. This section is concluded with a summary.
    The writer ends the paper with some concluding remarks.
</p>

<p>
    While the paper does not have a research question it has a clear research problem, which is actually tackled.
    However the problem is divided in two parts. The first is the lack of metrics that relate to the properties that
    emerge from OOD, which indicated the need for such metrics. The second part concentrates on the theoretical
    criticism of metrics applied to conventional non-OO applications. The second part is a valid argument to include a
    theoretical base in the research, but the previous research that brings the argument merely focuses on complexity
    metrics. The writer lacks of explicitly scoping the research to complexity metrics, but abides to this point of view
    throughout the rest of the paper. With the constructive use of complexity as point of view and the use of a
    theoretical basis that is based on complexity measures [Weyuker], the writer should have added this in the title,
    abstract or introduction of the paper. For example I find that 'A Complexity Metrics Suite for Object Oriented
    Design' would be a more appropriate title. <br>
    Also the concept of complexity is never introduced. The concept of software complexity could be interpreted in
    different ways [Brooks - Silver Bullet].
</p>

<p>
    Focusing on the first argument, existing metrics do not relate to the properties of OOD, the writer fails to
    demonstrate this or refer to previous works that indicate this. Although the reader can assume the lack of these
    metrics due to maturation of object oriented development at that time, it is not proper from the writers perspective
    to omit this assumption, references to previous work. The previous work that is referenced include suggestions and
    attempts for suitable metrics, but these sources, or the author lacks to indicate the missing relations of existing
    metrics with the OOD properties.
</p>

<p>
    In the most important section of the paper the writer iterates over each proposed metric. The writer applies the
    same pattern for each metric, which implicitly sets the expectation for the reader, which I found pretty comforting.
    For each metric the writer gives a clear definition, theoretical basis and point of view. The description and the
    theoretical basis result in the what and the motivation. The point of view for each metric add a more vivid argument
    for the sense of the metric. Some of these arguments are more application type specific. For example: 'The larger
    the number of methods that can be invoked from a class, the greater the complexity of the class.'. I cannot reason
    about the types of application that were developed in the time of the paper, but for example in the present day
    there are a lot of APIs that separate their data from their logic. This is more procedural than OO, but more
    practical. The method count however would be much higher in the data objects while they tend to be much simpler than
    the code in the domain specific layer of an application. Independently from small doubtful point of views, the
    arguments that made are solid.<br>
    Where the point of view of the paper is convincing, the theoretical basis lacks detail on a few points. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Definition of the NOC metric states: 'number of immediate subclasses subordinated of a class in the class
        hierarchy', however the theoretical basis states: 'it is a measure of how many subclasses are going to inherit
        the methods of the parent class'. The number of inheriting classes is not equal to the immediate subclasses of a
        class.
    </li>
    <li>
        The LCOM metric is computation based on the intersection of accessed fields of two methods. To identify two
        methods with or without accessed field similarity, the writer uses the notion of pairs. These pairs however are
        computed using the cartesian product of a list containing field access sets (which are mapped from the
        methods). The cartesian product holds the reflexive relational property, which by the definition will decrease
        the outcome with at least the number of the number of elements in the set consistent of the field access sets.
        The theoretical basis of LCOM states 'the larger the number of similar methods, the more cohesive the class',
        but a simple counter example shows that there is a bug in the definition. Assume we have a set of instance
        variables: ${I_1, I_2}$ and a set of methods ${M_1, M_2}$ where $M_1$ uses $I_1$ and $M_2$ uses $I_1$, then from
        the LCOM definition, $P = \{( \{I_1\}, \{I_2\} ), ( \{I_2\}, \{I_1\} ) \}$ and
        $Q = \{( \{I_1\}, \{I_1\} ), ( \{I_2\}, \{I_2\} ) \}$. This will produce the LCOM value $0$ that indicates that
        the class is most cohesive, but $M_1$ and $M_2$ do not relate in a single matter. This is shown in other papers
        as well [1].
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These points show the some metrics are not sound in a manner that there is no symbiosis between the definition and
    the application.
</p>
<p>
    After each metric is made clear the writer gives an analytical evaluation of the metric and presents the empirical
    data. The analytical evaluation is a formal proof which indicates that each metric complies to the metric properties
    specified by [Weyuker].
</p>

<p>
    The writer summarizes the result in the last part of the paper, but also introduces new concepts of how the combined
    metrics could be used as design indicators, why some properties of the metrics model are not met and why and the
    future direction of research. I rather have seen this in separate sections, mainly due to the reason that these
    components deserve their own section. The introduced point of views of combined metrics is a main contribution of
    the paper as it may improve design, which directly relates to the title. As well as future work, which normally gets
    its own section.
</p>

<p>
    To round up, the paper is well structured and has a clear contribution. The research problem is clear, but the
    approach tends to focus mainly on complexity metrics and has some that could be described more explicitly, and it
    has some inconsistencies in th metric definition and application. However the presented data is solid.
    As intended, the metrics can be be used as indicators to prevent fault as Basili et al. showed [1].

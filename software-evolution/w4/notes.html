<p>Lord Kelvin: To measure is to know. Thus measure provides knowledge.</p>

<p>TODO - Literature | Software Metrics: A rigorous & practical approach</p>

<h2>What is a metric?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What do we have to know? Goal</li>
  <li>Right result</li>
  <li>Meaningful statement</li>
</ul>

<p>Metrics start from intuition and observation</p>


<p><strong>Properties</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Metrics should always hold</li>
  <li>THere is always subjectivity</li>
  <li>Metrics are as usefull as its model</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scales</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Nominal: naming</li>
  <li>Ordinal: Sortable, but no calculation</li>
  <li>Interval: defines measurable distance (simple calculation allowed (diff))</li>
  <li>Ratio: Has a zero point. (kelvin)</li>
  <li>Absolute: No argument to the application.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the different scale you can determine what and what not is meaningful.</p>

<h2>Take away</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Metrics are an abstraction, which is based on a model</li>
  <li>Where do metrics sit on the scaling hierarchy?</li>
  <li>Determine what you can do with the defined metric</li>
</ul>

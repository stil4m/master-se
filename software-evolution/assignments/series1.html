    <h1>Series 1</h1>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>

    <p>
        In series 1 we focus on software metrics. Software metrics are used (for example) by the Software Improvement
        Group
        (http://www.sig.eu) to quickly gain an overview of the quality of software systems and to pinpoint problem areas
        that may cause low maintainability.
    </p>

    <p>Some relevant questions are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Which metrics are used?</li>
        <li>How are these metrics computed?</li>
        <li>How well do these metrics indicate what we really want to know about these systems and how can we judge
            that?
        </li>
        <li>How can we improve any of the above?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In other words, you have to worry about motivation and interpretation of metrics, as well as correct
        implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The SIG Maintainability Model provides an answer to question 1. You can read about it here: Ilja Heitlager,
        Tobias
        Kuipers, and Joost Visser, A Practical Model for Measuring Maintainability, In proceedings of the 6th
        International
        Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology (QUATIC 2007), pages 30-39, IEEE Computer
        Society Press, 2007, <a
            href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/QUATIC.2007.8">http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/QUATIC.2007.8</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        The second question above (“How are these metrics computed?”) is your assignment for series 1. The third and
        fourth
        questions will be addressed during the grading session.
    </p>

    <h4>Collaboration</h4>

    <p>Please make groups of two students. You can work together as a pair on all aspects of this assignment.</p>

    <p>
        You can brainstorm with anybody else about the contents of your essay, but for this assignment you are not
        allowed
        to look at code from other groups or exchange solutions in detail with other groups.
    </p>

    <h4>Assignment</h4>

    <p>Using Rascal, design and build a tool that calculates the SIG maintainability model scores for a Java
        project.</p>

    <p>Calculate at least the following metrics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Volume,</li>
        <li>Unit Size,</li>
        <li>Unit Complexity,</li>
        <li>Duplication.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For all metrics you calculate the actual metric values, for Unit Size and Unit Complexity you additionally
        calculate
        a risk profile, and finally each metric gets a score based on the SIG model (--, -, o, +, ++).
    </p>

    <p>
        Calculate scores for at least the following maintainability aspects based on the SIG model:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Maintainability (overall),</li>
        <li>Analysability,</li>
        <li>Changeability,</li>
        <li>Testability.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You can earn bonus points by also implementing the Test Quality metric and a score for the Stability
        maintainability
        aspect.
    </p>

    <p>
        Use this zip file to obtain compilable versions of two Java systems (smallsql and hsqldb): <a href="software-evolution/resources/assignment1.zip">zip file</a>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>smallsql</strong> is a small system to use for experimentation and testing. Import as-is into
            Eclipse
            and ignore build errors.
        </li>
        <li><strong>hsqldb</strong> is a larger system to demonstrate scalability. Import into Eclipse, make sure to
            have
            only hsqldb/src on the build path, and add the following external jars from your eclipse/plugins/ directory:
            javax.servlet_VERSION.jar and org.apache.ant_VERSION/lib/ant.jar
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Hints</h4>

    <p>
        Create an Eclipse Java project with example files to test you solution on (using the Rascal test
        functionality).
    </p>

    <p>
        Create an Eclipse Java project for each of the two systems, smallsql and hsqldb too. Some few lines of code will
        still not compile, but commenting them out would not change the metrics too much. So commenting out just a few
        lines is ok in this case. It saves time!
    </p>


    <h4>Grading</h4>

    <p>
        The assignment is judged by demonstrating your results and your code to us in a small interactive session. At
        the end of this session you will immediately get a grade between 3 and 10.
    </p>

    <p>
        You also have to drop a zip file with all code and relevant document in the assignments. The files are checked
        for plagiarism automatically. If you worked in a team of two, drop your assignment twice: one for each student!
    </p>

    <p>
        You will be graded using the following model:
    </p>

    <p>
        The base grade is 7. For this grade you need an implementation that conforms to the assignment described above.
        The implementation consists of sensible design and code. You can explain and motivate how it actually reads in
        the Java code and calculates the metrics based on that. Your implementation can be run during the grading
        session on at least the smallsql project. For grading, import the smallsql project into Eclipse as-is and ignore
        the 100 or so build errors.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following conditions modify the grade (the teachers have a reference implementation that provides the
        correct outputs):

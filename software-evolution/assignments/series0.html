<h1>Series 0</h1>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
    In this lab you learn the basic facts about Rascal and quickly learn to program in it. The idea is to
    interact with Rascal using the RascalTutor environment and Eclipse. See
    <a href="http://www.rascal-mpl.org" target="_blank">http://www.rascal-mpl.org</a>
    for download and
    installation instructions.
</p>

<p>
    Once you have started the Rascal/Eclipse environment, you can activate the RascalTutor by selecting the
    menu Rascal &gt; Start Tutor. The non-interactive tutor can also be found at
    <a href="http://tutor.rascal-mpl.org" target="_blank">http://tutor.rascal-mpl.org</a>.

</ul>

<h4>Collaboration</h4>

<p>
    Please do these exercises individually. Any communication between students is allowed, but bear in mind
    that you should personally be capable to code in Rascal after this. Your Rascal knowledge will also be
    validated in a personal online test.
</p>

<h4>Assignment</h4>

<p>
    Fully explore the Rascal course using the tutor and teach yourself Rascal. You will be assisted in the
    laboratory to install the system and type your first expressions and statements. Please ask the teachers
    any question about Rascal or the exercises you might have. It will be hard work!
</p>
<h4>Grading</h4>

<p>
    This series is not graded. If you pass most of the exercises in the tutor, you will know enough Rascal to
    do series 1 and 2. However, <strong>2 November</strong> you will do a personal online test. You have to
    pass more than 50% of the questions of this test, to be able to pass for the entire course.
</p>

<h4>Deadline</h4>
<p>
    You should finish Series 0 in the second week of the course.

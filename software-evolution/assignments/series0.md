# Series 0

#### Introduction

In this lab you learn the basic facts about Rascal and quickly learn to program in it. The idea is to interact with Rascal using the RascalTutor environment and Eclipse. See [http://www.rascal-mpl.org](http://www.rascal-mpl.org) for download and installation instructions.

Once you have started the Rascal/Eclipse environment, you can activate the RascalTutor by selecting the menu Rascal > Start Tutor. The non-interactive tutor can also be found at [http://tutor.rascal-mpl.org](http://tutor.rascal-mpl.org).

*   Comments on the documentation can be given at the bottom of each page
*   Discussion and questions can be posted at the online forum via [http://www.rascal-mpl.org](http://www.rascal-mpl.org)
*   Bugs can be submitted via [https://github.com/cwi-swat/rascal/issues](https://github.com/cwi-swat/rascal/issues)

#### Collaboration

Please do these exercises individually. Any communication between students is allowed, but bear in mind that you should personally be capable to code in Rascal after this. Your Rascal knowledge will also be validated in a personal online test.

#### Assignment

Fully explore the Rascal course using the tutor and teach yourself Rascal. You will be assisted in the laboratory to install the system and type your first expressions and statements. Please ask the teachers any question about Rascal or the exercises you might have. It will be hard work!

#### Grading

This series is not graded. If you pass most of the exercises in the tutor, you will know enough Rascal to do series 1 and 2\. However, **2 November** you will do a personal online test. You have to pass more than 50% of the questions of this test, to be able to pass for the entire course.

#### Deadline

You should finish Series 0 in the second week of the course.

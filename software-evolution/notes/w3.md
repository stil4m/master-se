# Lecture 3 - Reverse Engineering
<small>2015-11-09 - Vadim Zaytsev</small>

Reverse engineering is used to detect design. Reverse engineering requirements gives more confidence and shows business rules.

In the lanes of slide 3, refactoring goes back to architecture, when it is not it is just cleanup. Bugs tend to go everywhere.

## Code reverse engineering

Techniques

*   Parsing: Recognising Structure
*   Fact Extraction: Parsing + fact base
*   Slicing
*   Pattern Matching
*   Decomposition
*   Exploration

Comments

*   With slicing you remove unnecessary code. You can find cohesion.
*   Pattern matching visits a structure and acts when the pattern holds
*   Decomposition is an NP hard problem. Only possible with brute force.
*   Exploration: Find what you looking for and omit all the rest.

## Data Reverse Engineering

WEKA - TODO lookup

Goals

*   Database design recovery
*   Pattern recognition
*   Information retrieval
*   Clustering
*   Mining unstructured data

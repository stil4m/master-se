Lord Kelvin: To measure is to know. Thus measure provides knowledge.

TODO - Literature | Software Metrics: A rigorous &amp; practical approach

## What is a metric?

*   What do we have to know? Goal
*   Right result
*   Meaningful statement

Metrics start from intuition and observation

**Properties**

*   Metrics should always hold
*   There is always subjectivity
*   Metrics are as useful as its model

## Scales

*   Nominal: naming
*   Ordinal: Sortable, but no calculation
*   Interval: defines measurable distance (simple calculation allowed (diff))
*   Ratio: Has a zero point. (kelvin)
*   Absolute: No argument to the application.

With the different scale you can determine what and what not is meaningful.

## Take away

*   Metrics are an abstraction, which is based on a model
*   Where do metrics sit on the scaling hierarchy?
*   Determine what you can do with the defined metric

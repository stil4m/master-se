# Lecture 6 - Source Code Manipulation
<small>2015-11-30 - Vadim Zaytsev</small>

Two parts of Source Code Manipulation (slide 3 & 4)

*   Vertical: compiling
*   Horizontal: refactoring/transformation

## Vertical

### Generated code

*   Preferably
    *   Avoid any evolution
    *   Regenerate on sync
*   Possibly
    *   Bidirectional link
*   Properties
    *   Correct
    *   Speed
    *   Size
    *   Energy

TODO - Literature: Bidirectional elaboration of dependently typed programs.

### Super compilation

*   Not completely compile. Only the parts which you can pre-compute.
*   Control where you stop

### Partial Application (currying

*   Partial evaluation -> For example Slicing
*   Lazy evaluation
*   Theorem proving/problem solving

## Horizontal

### Language conversion

Everybody lies. It cannot be done

TODO lit - The realities of language conversion.

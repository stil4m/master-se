## Types of clones

*   Type 1: Exact copy ignoring whitespace and comments.
*   Type 2: Syntactical copies. Changes allowed in variables, types and function identifiers.
*   Type 3: Copy with changes (addition or deletion of statements).
*   Type 4: Functional clone. It does the same, but the code may be completely different.

## Type of algorithms

Examples of clone detection algorithms

*   Text search
*   Token
*   Metrics based
*   Abstract Syntax Tree
*   Program Dependency Graphs

<h5>Opinion</h5>

<p>
  A very interesting paper describing a problem that I think is troubling in modern software development.
  Not only for massive projects where it is impossible to grasp the idea of the time that is needed to execute the tests,
  but also for the newer projects that run on Agile where you want to have small load/overhead during the short development cycles.
</p>

<p>
  An interesting 'missing' element in this paper is the notion when these strategies become applicable in a certain project when validness, iteration length and size of the project are the different variables.

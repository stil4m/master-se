## Universal Intellectual Standards

*   Clarity:
    *   When is it explained enough subjective with target audience in mind.
*   Accuracy
    *   100 lines a day. Clear, but not accurate (only week days?)
*   Precision
    *   Maintenance is important. Not precise.
    *   Precision requires a sufficient matter of detail.
*   Depth
    *   The amount to zoom in.
*   Breath
    *   The diversity in the subject matter.
    *   Stick to one point of view is lack of breath.
*   Significance
    *   What is significant for the particular problem
*   Fairness
    *   Is it biased? Is the data processing correct.

### Important notes

*   You need both depth and breath. It should be a 'T' shaped thing
*   You must ensure the quality of thinking yourself.

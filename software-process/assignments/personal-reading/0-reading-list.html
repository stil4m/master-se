<h1>Personal Reading - List of topics</h1>

<h2>Personal goals</h2>

<p>
  I hope to get better understanding about the choices I have to make as a Software Engineer. I believe that these
  reading assignments help with this, but I find it hard to formalize these to concrete topics. I hope to learn that to
  have a better judgement on my actions to reach a certain goal (given a certain situation). The trend in the topics I
  have chosen follows this pattern. As a second goal I hope to learn from my fellow students by knowledge sharing (maybe
  something to adopt into the curriculum). When 40 students study different topics every week, there must be something
  that I could learn.

<p>
  To ask me for my 'strongest believes' is a somewhat peculiar question. I've been in the industry for a while and
  learned that you cannot conform to a single believe because context is changing continuously. I decided to set a more
  abstract believe: You must always look out for ways to adapt your workflow, if you are doing bad, but also if you are
  doing great. Routine is the root of unexpected setbacks. You should embrace new practices when you believe (at that
  moment in time) that it serve the greater good.

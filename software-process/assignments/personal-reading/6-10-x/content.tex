\section*{What is 10x?}

TODO - Programmers that are more effective (making software)
TODO - Its origin (beginning of software development)
TODO - need from managers (demarco)

\section*{What do we know?}

TODO - Sackman 1966 start, 28:1 ish
TODO - DeMarco shows critical view and overturn to 5:1
TODo - Augustin \autocite{augustine}

\section*{Measurement}

TODO - variations in measurement
TODO - Why is it effective
TODO - maybe oppertunistic? character, arguable that 10x, but not effective in industry
TODO - demarco with work envorinment. Show great influence on individual state/form

\section*{Is it effective?}

TODO - Environment is never the same.
TODO - Making software, you need a goal
TODO - Augustin, but what about the quarterback?
TODO - Counter effective?
   > Making software slacker
   > Good results
   > A good programmer, which is actually not measured correctly does not get his appreciation.
   > Moves to a company where he is 'valued' a.k.a. oppionion respected, listening and resulting in bettter communication and better code?
TODO - Database developer - is java
\section*{Is it real?}

TODO - I believe it is real, just a gut feeling.
TODO - Measurement is just too hard due to the environment, as we can see from demarco's work.
TODO - Making software tries to make an argument on lotus/excel. Hire policy and env?

\section*{Conclusion}

TODO - Questionable if we can say something.
TODO - The organization and the project form make the difference.

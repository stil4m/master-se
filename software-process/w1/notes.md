# Lecture 1 - Software Process Introduction
<small>2016-02-01 - Hans Dekkers</small>

## Goals

The goals for this project are to create a good notion of how to approach the process in difficult software projects.
For example:


* Creating a successor of blackboard
* Choose a company from a list of companies that can deliver high value software
* Make a team with another culture in another country work
* Gather people for a product development startup. Create a functional group by adding 2 or 3 members.

## Setup

* Organisation, coordination, control
* Empirical study
* Make decisions: 'how much planning is needed'.

For the reading assignments, mostly survey papers are suggested.

## Questions

* You said you were interested in the process of setting up high competitive rowing teams. In your experience, are you looking for the same aspects in software teams? or product development teams?

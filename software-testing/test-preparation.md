# Test Preparation

#### Topics

*   Proof by induction
*   Hoare Triple
*   Laws of propositional logic (Haskell Road to Logic, Theorem 2.10)

*   Study answers on workshop 5\. Probably we will get questions about trees in the test.
*   Write Haskell implementations for reflexive, transitive and symmetric closures.
*   Read up about injective, surjective and bijective.
*   Implement balance for trees and write a proof with induction.
*   Write sized generator for QuickCheck
*   Write a `foldT` implementation to handle trees with information at the internal nodes.
*   Write a `foldT` for trees with 3 child nodes.
*   Write a `mapT` for trees with both information on the leaves and on the nodes.
*   Read and use the QuickCheck preconditions.
*   Do the review questions in the lectures.

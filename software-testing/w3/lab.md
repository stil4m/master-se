# Lab 3 Software Specification and Testing

#### 1\. Implement tautology, contradiction and equivalence. <small>Together with Jasper</small>

Easy exercise. No problems verifying the implementations.

#### 2\. Parse for formal logic formulas

_Performed by Paco and Nikki_

#### 3\. Formulas to CNF <small>Together with Jasper</small>

_Harder exercise due to the recursion and correcting the nodes in the tree. Easy to test however._

#### 4\. Parse for formal logic formulas

_Performed by Paco and Nikki_

#### (Bonus) 5\. CNF Clauses <small>Together with Jasper</small>

_I did the implementation, Jasper wrote a cool generator for arbitrary CNF notations._

<h1>Lab 3 Software Specification and Testing</h1>

<h4>1. Implement tautology, contradiction and equivalence.
  <small>Together with Jasper</small>
</h4>

<p>
  Easy exercise. No problems verifying the implementations.
</p>

<h4>2. Parse for formal logic formulas</h4>

<p>
  <i>Performed by Paco and Nikki</i>
</p>

<h4>3. Formulas to CNF
  <small>Together with Jasper</small>
</h4>

<p>
  <i>Harder exercise due to the recursion and correcting the nodes in the tree. Easy to test however.</i>
</p>


<h4>4. Parse for formal logic formulas</h4>

<p>
  <i>Performed by Paco and Nikki</i>
</p>

<h4>(Bonus) 5. CNF Clauses
  <small>Together with Jasper</small>
</h4>

<p>
  <i>I did the implementation, Jasper wrote a cool generator for arbitrary CNF notations.</i>

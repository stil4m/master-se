<h1>Lab 2: Software Specification and Testing</h1>


<h4>1. Regocnizing Triangles <small>Together with Nikki</small></h4>

<p>
  Easy exercise. Had some more problems of testing the properties when these are related to the input.
  This implementation removes my personal need for unit tests.
</p>

<h4>2. Recognizing Permutations</h4>

<p>
    <i>Performed by Paco and Jasper</i>
</p>

<h4>3. Recognizing and generating derangements <small>Together with Paco</small></h4>

<p>
  Implemented with paco. We can see the power of the composition of properties
  and what this does with the post condition of the composition.
</p>

<h4>4. Implementing and testing IBAN validation</h4>

<p>
    <i>Performed by Nikki and Jasper</i>
</p>

<h4>Bonus</h4>
<p>
  We decided to do <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=135">Euler 135</a>.
  I solved it, but it was not performing.
  Afterwards we were using <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=31">Problem 31</a>.
  This was pretty easy.

# Lab 2: Software Specification and Testing

#### 1\. Regocnizing Triangles <small>Together with Nikki</small>

Easy exercise. Had some more problems of testing the properties when these are related to the input. This implementation removes my personal need for unit tests.

#### 2\. Recognizing Permutations

_Performed by Paco and Jasper_

#### 3\. Recognizing and generating derangements <small>Together with Paco</small>

Implemented with paco. We can see the power of the composition of properties and what this does with the post condition of the composition.

#### 4\. Implementing and testing IBAN validation

_Performed by Nikki and Jasper_

#### Bonus

We decided to do [Euler 135](https://projecteuler.net/problem=135). I solved it, but it was not performing. Afterwards we were using [Problem 31](https://projecteuler.net/problem=31). This was pretty easy.

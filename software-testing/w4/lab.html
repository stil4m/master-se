<h1>Lab 4 Software Specification and Testing</h1>

<h4>1. Read Haskell Road Chapter 4</h4>

<p>Re-read it. Was pretty easy.</p>

<h4>2. Implement random data generator for
  <code>Set Int</code>.
  <small>Together with Nikki</small>
</h4>

<p>
  We were stuck on the generic data type generator. In the end we had a generator, but Alex helped me out on this exercise
  to create an arbitrary.
</p>

<h4>3. Implement union, intersection and difference and test these.
  <small>Together with Nikki</small>
</h4>

<p>
  Easy exercise. Hard part was identifying the properties of each operation.

<h4>4. Read Haskell Road Chapter 5</h4>

<p>Re-read it. Was pretty easy.</p>

<h4>5. Implement the symmetric closure </h4>

<p>
  <i>Performed by Paco and Jasper</i>
</p>

<h4>6. Implement the transitive closure.</h4>

<p>
  <i>Performed by Paco and Jasper</i>
</p>

<h4>7. Test the symmetric and transitive closure.</h4>

<p>
  <i>Performed by Paco and Jasper</i>
</p>

<h4>8. Show the difference between a transitive closure of a symmetric closure and vice versa</h4>

<p>
  <i>Performed by Paco and Nikki</i>
</p>


<h4>(Bonus) 9. Create a show and parse for imperative statements.</h4>

<p>
  Created a show. Jasper and Nikki as well. Jaspers show was the nicest.
</p>

<h4>(Bonus) 10. Do a project Euler exercise.</h4>

<p>
  We did 120. The solution I came up was the nicest, because it used the parity of a number to influence a map instead of having
  a if statement with a lot of duplicate code.

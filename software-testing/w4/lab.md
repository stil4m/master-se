# Lab 4 Software Specification and Testing

#### 1. Read Haskell Road Chapter 4

Re-read it. Was pretty easy.

#### 2. Implement random data generator for `Set Int`. <small>Together with Nikki</small>

We were stuck on the generic data type generator. In the end we had a generator, but Alex helped me out on this exercise to create an arbitrary.

#### 3. Implement union, intersection and difference and test these. <small>Together with Nikki</small>

Easy exercise. Hard part was identifying the properties of each operation.

#### 4. Read Haskell Road Chapter 5

Re-read it. Was pretty easy.

#### 5. Implement the symmetric closure

_Performed by Paco and Jasper_

#### 6. Implement the transitive closure.

_Performed by Paco and Jasper_

#### 7. Test the symmetric and transitive closure.

_Performed by Paco and Jasper_

#### 8. Show the difference between a transitive closure of a symmetric closure and vice versa

_Performed by Paco and Nikki_

#### (Bonus) 9. Create a show and parse for imperative statements.

Created a show. Jasper and Nikki as well. Jaspers show was the nicest.

#### (Bonus) 10. Do a project Euler exercise.

We did 120. The solution I came up was the nicest, because it used the parity of a number to influence a map instead of having a if statement with a lot of duplicate code.

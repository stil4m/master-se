<h1>Lab 1: Functional Programming and (Some) Logic</h1>


<h4>1. Implement and test the Luhn Algorithm</h4>

<p>Very easy exercise. Interesting warm up to get familiar with the Haskell syntax. Not a real challenge.</p>


<h4>2. Crime Scene Investigation</h4>

<p>
    Hard exercise due to the vague definition of <i>telling the truth</i> and <i>telling lies</i>.
    I ended up with a implementation that was very naive. For example:
</p>

<pre>
says Jack x = not (says Matthew x) && not (says Peter x)
</pre>

<p>
    This statement would reflect <i>Jack says that Matthew and Peter are both lying.</i>.
    However the statement does not say if Matthew and Peter lie about all their accusations, but the code assumes this.
</p>

<p>
    If a more advanced implementation should be implemented then I am not sure if this is possible with the form that
    was handed with the exercise, because it would be more alike to epistemic logic.
</p>


<h4>3. Bonus (Project Euler problems 9, 10 and 49.)</h4>

<p>
    These problems were more easy than the second exercise. In the pre-master course 'functional programming' I already
    played a little bit with Haskell and Project Euler. I only had to implement problem 49.
    I wonder if problem 49 can be written more compact and if problem 10 could be implemented faster.

## Beyer & Holtzblatt - Contextual Design

Contextual Design is a design approach that will support the understanding of the customers workflow.
The paper also states that Contextual Design will help cross-functional teams to come to an agreement on what their customers need.

The process of Contextual Design contains the following steps:

* **Contextual Inquiry**: Talk to individuals in their workplace while they are using the system. Helps understanding the tasks and gets more information while people are not always able to translate their tasks into words.
* **Work Modelling** Draw models representing the work of the customers you talk to. Shows structure in work that can be shared and validated. This can also be shared across the functional teams.
* **Consolidation**: Create a single statement of the work practice of your market or organisation. This requires the collection of data from individuals and to see common patterns.
* **Work Redesign**: Invent and develop better ways to work. This uses the consolidated data and presents it in for example storyboards.
* **User Environment Design**: Represent the entire system for product planning, marketing, UI design and specification. Creates a 'floor plan' for the new system. This supports the teams insight into the requirements on each system.
* **Mockup and Test with Customers**: Test and iterate the design with customers using rough paper mockups. This will allow the team to use the ideas from the User Environment Design and test them on users. Enables refinement and detects problems.

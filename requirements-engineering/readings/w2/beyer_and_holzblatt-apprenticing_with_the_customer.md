# Apprenticing With the Customer

Apprenticing with the customer describes a view on the Contextual Inquiry,
which is described in the Contextual design (an earlier read in this course).

The paper describes the fundamental problem problem in the relationship between customers and designers is that of enabling learning:
How do designers learn enough about customers' work to design well?
What kind of relationship allows customers to impart deep knowledge about their work?
The metaphor they present is the 'master and apprentice relation' (which IMHO is irrelevant to their theory).
This traditional relationship underlies the model of relationship on which Contextual Inquiry relies.

Critical aspects of the master-apprentice relation are:

* **Teaching ability is not needed**: Teaching is not the primary job of the customer, they are the master craftsperson. A master teaches by doing the work and talking about it while working.
* **Seeing the work reveals what matters**: People are not aware of everything they do. For example: Some actions are the result of years of experience and have subtle reasons. Customers are not aware of everything they do or why they do it; they become aware in the doing. For the customer it is not natural to stop working and talk about it. The apprentice relationship allows the apprentice to see work and justify it without requiring the master to stop working.
* **Seeing the work reveals details**: As a master or apprentice observes a pattern or principle in action, he or she can point it out immediately.
